I carried out a PhD at the University of Exeter to understand the decline of migratory waterfowl using biologging technology. You can find out more about this work from the University of Exeter [here](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Luke_Ozsanlav-Harris) and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust [here](https://www.wwt.org.uk/our-work/wetland-conservation-unit/meet-the-team/luke-ozsanlav-harris/).
