Currently I carry out scientific and technical work for the global flyways programme at BirdLife international. In the past I have carried out a variety of work on animal movement, populaiton demography and migration. In the past I did a PhD at the University of Exeter to understand the decline of Greenland White-fronted Goose using biologging technology.
