I carried out a PhD at the University of Exeter to understand the decline of migratory waterfowl using biologging technology. You can find out more about this work from the University of Exeter [here](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Luke_Ozsanlav-Harris). 

I am currently a conservation scientist at the RSPB. I am investigating the drivers of lowland breeding wader populations in order to predict which future conservation scenarios would maximise the benefits to breeding populations.
