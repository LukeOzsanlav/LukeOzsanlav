I carried out a PhD at the University of Exeter to understand the decline of migratory waterfowl using biologging technology. You can find out more about this work from the University of Exeter [here](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Luke_Ozsanlav-Harris) and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust [here](https://www.wwt.org.uk/our-work/wetland-conservation-unit/meet-the-team/luke-ozsanlav-harris/).

## Projects
- `Seabird_AvoidanceRates`: Calculating avoidance rates for collision risk modelling of seabird-windfarm interactions 
- `AnimalBioMethods`: A method to classifying incubation in birds from biologging data
- `Islay_LeadGeese`: Code and data from a MS investing lead ingestion in waterfowl
- `GWfGMetapopDemography`: Code and data from a MS determining drivers of reproducitve success in an Arctic breeding goose species
- `HMM_app`: Shiny app to fit hidden markov models to individual movement tracks
- `YBW_Vagrancy`: Code and data from a MS exploring the origins of vagrant Yellow-browed Warblers in the UK
